Building an AI-Powered Data Summarizer in Python

Learn how to clean structured data with Pandas and generate intelligent summaries using an LLM API — with production-friendly patterns.

🚀 What You'll Build

In this tutorial, you’ll build a small Python application that:

1. Loads structured data from a CSV file

2. Cleans and preprocesses it using Pandas

3. Generates natural-language summaries using an AI API

4. Wraps everything in clean, modular Python code

By the end, you'll have a reusable pipeline for turning structured datasets into readable summaries
